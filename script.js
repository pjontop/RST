I'm currently developing an autonomous drone system from the ground up‚Äîincluding PCB design, flight control algorithms, and sensor integration‚Äîand also built "Mesa," an AI-driven healthcare resource optimization tool that earned recognition in a Stanford-affiliated global research program. I have strong hands-on experience in Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and embedded systems, along with a growing portfolio of projects in both software and hardware.</p>
                            
                            <p>In addition to my technical work, I'm organizing "Daydream Ottawa," the capital's largest youth-led hackathon, where I coordinate logistics, secure sponsorships, and lead workshops to inspire fellow students. My ability to manage large-scale projects, collaborate across teams, and mentor others reflects my dedication to both engineering excellence and community growth. I'm confident that I can bring this same energy, discipline, and creativity to your organization.</p>

                    <p>Below are my responses to common interview questions. Each response demonstrates my self-awareness, growth mindset, and leadership capabilities.</p>
                    
                    <div class="interview-section">
                        <div class="interview-question">1. Tell me about something about yourself that you are trying to work on or improve. Why do you feel like that is something important for your work life?</div>
                        <div class="interview-answer">
                            <p>One area I'm actively working to improve is my ability to delegate effectively while maintaining high standards. As someone who's passionate about excellence and has experience leading technical projects like our autonomous drone development and organizing "Daydream Ottawa," I sometimes find myself taking on too many responsibilities personally rather than empowering team members to grow.</p>
                            
                            <p>I recognize this is crucial for my work life because effective delegation isn't just about reducing my workload‚Äîit's about developing others, scaling impact, and creating sustainable team dynamics. In my role organizing Canada's largest youth hackathon, I've learned that when I delegate thoughtfully and provide clear guidance, team members often exceed my expectations and bring innovative perspectives I wouldn't have considered.</p>
                            
                            <p>I'm addressing this by implementing structured check-ins with team members, clearly defining expectations upfront, and creating mentorship opportunities where I can guide others while allowing them to take ownership. This approach has already improved our project outcomes and helped develop stronger technical capabilities across our teams.</p>

                            <p>I've developed a multi-faceted approach to stress management that's essential given my demanding schedule balancing a 3.9 GPA in Pre-IB, multiple technical projects, and organizing major events like "Daydream Ottawa."</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Physical Activity:</strong> I maintain regular training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai, which provides both physical stress relief and mental clarity. These disciplines have taught me to stay calm under pressure and think strategically even in challenging situations.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Structured Planning:</strong> I use time-blocking and project management tools to break complex projects like our autonomous drone development into manageable tasks. This prevents overwhelm and provides a clear sense of progress.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Technical Problem-Solving as Meditation:</strong> Interestingly, I find that diving deep into coding or working on circuit design for our drone project actually helps me decompress. The focused problem-solving activates a flow state that reduces stress.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Community Connection:</strong> Mentoring peers and participating in collaborative projects reminds me that challenges are shared experiences. Teaching others often helps me gain new perspectives on my own obstacles.</p>
                            
                            <p>These strategies have proven essential for maintaining high performance across multiple demanding commitments while preserving my mental well-being.</p>

                        <div class="interview-question">3. What accomplishment in your life are you most proud of?</div>
                        <div class="interview-answer">
                            <p>While I'm proud of recognition like winning the Nokia Hackathon and receiving the Excellent Research Award from Stanford's Qualia Global Scholars Program, my greatest accomplishment is creating "Daydream Ottawa" and building a lasting impact on my local tech community.</p>
                            
                            <p>What makes me most proud isn't just the scale‚Äîorganizing Canada's capital's largest youth hackathon‚Äîbut the ripple effect it's created. I've watched students who attended our first event go on to start their own projects, pursue computer science education, and even launch their own startups. Several participants have told me that Daydream Ottawa was the first time they realized they could be creators of technology, not just consumers.</p>
                            
                            <p>The accomplishment required every skill I'd developed: technical expertise to design workshops, leadership to coordinate sponsors and volunteers, communication to inspire participants, and persistence to overcome the inevitable challenges of organizing a large-scale event. But seeing a shy Grade 7 student present their first app to a room full of industry mentors, or watching teams form friendships that extend far beyond the event, reminds me why I'm passionate about using technology to build community.</p>
                            
                            <p>This accomplishment represents my core belief: that the greatest impact comes not just from what we build, but from empowering others to build alongside us. It's a foundation I plan to carry into my future career in technology and innovation.</p>

                        <div class="interview-question">4. Tell me about a time you found yourself in a leadership role. What did you learn from it?</div>
                        <div class="interview-answer">
                            <p>During the development of our Airline Management System project, I found myself naturally stepping into a leadership role when our team of four was struggling with conflicting ideas about system architecture and development approach.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>The Situation:</strong> Two team members wanted to use Java for the entire system, while another preferred Python, and we were facing a deadline with no clear direction. Rather than letting the debate continue, I suggested we step back and align on our goals first, then choose technologies based on what would best serve our users.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>My Approach:</strong> I organized structured sessions where each team member could present their technical reasoning, then facilitated a decision-making process based on objective criteria like performance requirements, team expertise, and long-term maintainability. We ultimately chose a hybrid approach using Java for the core logic and Python for data processing.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Key Learnings:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Leadership isn't about having all the answers</strong>‚Äîit's about creating space for the best ideas to emerge from the team</li>
                                <li><strong>Technical decisions should serve user needs</strong>, not just reflect personal preferences or familiarity</li>
                                <li><strong>Structured processes can turn conflict into collaboration</strong> when team members feel heard and respected</li>
                                <li><strong>Teaching while leading</strong> creates stronger teams; I spent time helping teammates understand new concepts rather than just assigning tasks</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>This experience shaped how I approach leadership in all my projects, from organizing Daydream Ottawa to mentoring peers. I learned that effective leadership combines technical competence with emotional intelligence and genuine care for team development.</p>

                        <div class="interview-question">5. Tell me about a time you failed. What did you learn from it?</div>
                        <div class="interview-answer">
                            <p>During my first attempt at developing the autonomous flight control system for our drone project, I experienced a significant failure that taught me valuable lessons about iterative development and the importance of testing assumptions early.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>The Failure:</strong> I spent three weeks developing what I thought was an elegant autonomous navigation algorithm, confident in my approach based on research papers and theoretical understanding. When we finally tested it with our physical drone prototype, it immediately crashed due to sensor lag issues I hadn't anticipated. Worse, the crash damaged components we'd spent weeks fabricating, setting our project back significantly.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>My Initial Reaction:</strong> I was devastated and embarrassed. As someone who takes pride in technical excellence and had been mentoring others, failing so publicly in front of my team was difficult to accept.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Theory must be validated incrementally:</strong> I should have started with simple simulations, then basic hardware tests, before attempting complex autonomous behavior</li>
                                <li><strong>Real-world systems have constraints that papers often omit:</strong> Sensor latency, environmental interference, and hardware limitations require practical experience, not just theoretical knowledge</li>
                                <li><strong>Failure is data, not defeat:</strong> The crash taught us more about our system's limitations in 30 seconds than weeks of theoretical work</li>
                                <li><strong>Team resilience matters more than individual perfection:</strong> My team's response‚Äîimmediately brainstorming solutions rather than assigning blame‚Äîshowed me the value of psychological safety in innovation</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> We rebuilt with a modular approach, testing each component thoroughly. The final system is more robust and reliable than my original design would have been. More importantly, this experience made me a better mentor‚ÄîI now emphasize iterative testing and learning from failure as core principles when guiding others.</p>
                            
                            <p>This failure taught me that in complex technical projects, the question isn't whether you'll encounter setbacks, but how quickly you can learn from them and adapt. It's a mindset that has served me well in subsequent projects and competitions.</p>
